{"type":"bioproject","identifier":"PRJNA13694","organism":"marine metagenome","title":"Metagenomic analysis of marine microbes isolated during the Global Ocean Sampling Expedition","description":"A broad objective of the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) Expedition is to assess the genetic diversity in marine microbial communities and understand their role in fundamental processes in nature. Marine microbes influence the cycling of carbon (and other elements) in the world's oceans, acting as a biological conduit that transports carbon dioxide from the surface to the deep oceanic realms. By sequestering carbon from the atmosphere, marine microorganisms (eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses) may significantly affect global climate. However, we know little about the physiological processes and complex interactions of communities that impact global carbon cycles and ocean productivity, and our attempts to study their activities are limited by our inability to culture the vast majority of them. These uncultured marine microorganisms are also a rich repository of novel genes and molecular structures that have potential in the development of biocatalysts for industrial and medical applications.\n<p>\nOne avenue of exploration is to sequence the genomes of marine microbes using a metagenomics approach. In 2003, the J. Craig Venter Institute conducted a whole environment shotgun sequencing project to study marine microorganisms in the nutrient-poor Sargasso Sea near Bermuda. This study revealed a remarkable breadth and depth of microbial diversity - about 1,800 different prokaryotic species encoding over 1.2 million genes were discovered. Notably, this study expanded our knowledge of ocean photobiology, microbial diversity and evolution. Results from the pilot study were reported in Science in 2004.\n<p>\nThis pilot study served as the springboard for launching a more comprehensive survey of the bacterial, archaeal and viral diversity of the world's oceans. A global circumnavigation aboard the Sorcerer II sailing yacht began in August 2003, starting in Halifax, Canada and samples were collected at sites along the U.S. east coast, Gulf of Mexico, Galapagos Islands, central and south Pacific Oceans, Australia, Indian Ocean, South Africa, across the Atlantic back to the U.S., and was completed in January 2006. An initial analysis of the microbial sequence data from the first leg of the trip - Halifax to the Galapagos Islands was reported in a special issue of PLoS Biology on Ocean Meganomics in March 2007 (see <a href=\"http://collections.plos.org/plosbiology/gos-2007\">http://collections.plos.org/plosbiology/gos-2007</a>). Additional data from the Indian Ocean was released in March 2008.  Shotgun sequencing and deep sequencing of 16S and 18S rRNA is currently underway on additional samples.\n<p>\nCollectively these studies have produced the largest catalogue of genes to date from thousands of new species, with no apparent slowing of the rate of discovery of novel gene families. These data have potentially far-reaching implications for biological energy production, bioremediation, and creating solutions for reduction/management of greenhouse gas levels in our biosphere.

AMD is a worldwide environmental problem that arises largely from microbial activity. Acid solutions form when rocks rich in sulfide minerals are oxidized upon exposure to air and water (acid rock drainage), but the rates of sulfide oxidation are typically slow and the sulfuric acid is rapidly neutralized by interaction with surrounding silicate minerals (hydrolysis reactions). Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of the AMD problem is that the majority of the AMD formed is due directly to microbial activity.\n<p>\nThis project is a genome-based approach that enables culture-independent understanding of microbial activity relevant to geochemical processes that occur in AMD systems. The biofilm sequencing project was designed to explore the distribution and diversity of metabolic pathways in these communities (e.g., nitrogen fixation, sulfur oxidation, iron oxidation), in order to understand the mechanisms by which the microbes tolerate the environmental extremes, and to evaluate how these tolerance mechanisms impact the geochemistry of the environment.\n<p>\nThis community sample was collected from a low-complexity microbial biofilm growing hundreds of feet underground within a pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) ore body.

Preliminary analysis found that 3% of these sequences align closest to elephant, indicating they are from the extinct mammmoth.  The rest of the sequences appear to be from prokaryotes that colonized the fossil.\n\nDNA extracted from a 43,000 old mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) bone from Bol'shaya Kolopatkaya River in Russia. Whereas evolutionary inferences derived from present-day DNA sequences are by necessity indirect, ancient DNA sequences provide a direct view of past genetic variants. However, base lesions that accumulate in DNA over time may cause nucleotide misincorporations when ancient DNA sequences are replicated. By repeated amplifications of mitochondrial DNA sequences from a large number of ancient wolf remains, we show that C/G-to-T/A transitions are the predominant type of such misincorporations. Using a massively parallel sequencing method that allows large numbers of single DNA strands to be sequenced, we show that modifications of C, as well as to a lesser extent of G, residues cause such misincorporations. Experiments where oligonucleotides containing modified bases are used as templates in amplification reactions suggest that both of these types of misincorporations can be caused by deamination of the template bases. New DNA sequencing methods in conjunction with knowledge of misincorporation processes have now, in principle, opened the way for the determination of complete genomes from organisms that became extinct during and after the last glaciation.","data type":"Genome sequencing and assembly","organization":"Max Planck Institute","publication":[{"id":"17715061","Title":"Patterns of damage in genomic DNA sequences from a Neandertal."},{"id":"16938852","Title":"Patterns of nucleotide misincorporations during enzymatic amplification and direct large-scale sequencing of ancient DNA."}],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":[],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2006-09-07","datePublished":"2006-09-05T00:00:00Z","_annotation":{"sample_count":3,"sample_organism":["fossil metagenome","Mammuthus primigenius"],"sample_taxid":["444079","37349"],"sample_host_organism":[],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":["Russia:Bol'shaya Kolopatkaya river"],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"sample_temperature_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"genome_count":0},"has_analysis":false}

Our lab has generated large-insert genomic libraries from genomic fragments of Monterey Bay microbes. These libraries have been characterized extensively, both phylogenetically through surveys of rDNA genes and functionally through surveys of genes of particular interest (e.g. proteorhodopsin, bacteriochlorophyll, rubisco). Many clones have been fully-sequenced, and each library has been end-sequenced. This project illuminates the community diversity, structure, and ecosystem functional potential of a coastal marine microbial community. In addition, monthly cruises since 1998 have sampled and archived microbial community DNA from Monterey Bay, and the genomic libraries provide vital context for interpreting the longer-term seasonal and annual changes in these communities.\n<p>\nConcentrated picoplankton cells from Monterey Bay, California, USA. \n<p>\nFour environmental genomic libraries were made from four depths:\n\nEB000: 3m depth, Station M2 (36.7°N, 122.4°W), collected 3/17/99. \n\n<p>BAC vector used, 8352 total clones, 80kb average \n<p>\nThe following BAC submissions are associated with this project:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=AE008919:AE008921[accn]\">AE008919-AE008921</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=AF268611\">AF268611</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=AF279106\">AF279106</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=AY372454\">AY372454</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=AY458629:AY458650[accn]\">AY458629-AY458650</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=EF089397:EF089400[accn]\">EF089397-EF089400</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=EF106972\">EF106972</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=EF107099:EF107100[accn]\">EF107099-EF107100</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=EF107104:EF107105[accn]\">EF107104-EF107105</a>\n\n\n","data type":"Metagenome","organization":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","publication":[{"id":"17359257","Title":"Proteorhodopsin photosystem gene clusters exhibit co-evolutionary trends and shared ancestry among diverse marine microbial phyla."},{"id":"10988064","Title":"Bacterial rhodopsin: evidence for a new type of phototrophy in the sea."},{"id":"11233160","Title":"Construction and analysis of bacterial artificial chromosome libraries from a marine microbial assemblage."},{"id":"11832943","Title":"Unsuspected diversity among marine aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs."},{"id":"14566056","Title":"Proteorhodopsin genes are distributed among divergent marine bacterial taxa."},{"id":"17472632","Title":"Quantitative distribution of presumptive archaeal and bacterial nitrifiers in Monterey Bay and the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre."},{"id":"18028413","Title":"Design and testing of 'genome-proxy' microarrays to profile marine microbial communities."}],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":[null],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2007-11-02","_annotation":{"sample_count":0,"sample_organism":[],"sample_taxid":[],"sample_host_organism":[],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":[],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"sample_temperature_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"genome_count":0},"has_analysis":false}

{"type":"bioproject","identifier":"PRJNA28969","organism":"marine metagenome","title":"Metagenomics and metatranscriptomics of marine plankton under conditions of ocean acidification","description":"The dissolution of anthropogenic CO2 from the atmosphere into the oceans will decrease surface pH by 0.3 units over the next 100 years (IPCC 2007); the phenomenon is referred to as ocean acidification (OA). There are concerns that OA will affect marine microorganisms, with significant impacts on marine biogeochemical cycling. To investigate the impact of this on marine microorganisms, a mesocosm experiment was set-up in a Norwegian Fjord in May 2006. \n<p>\nSix bags containing 11,000 L of sea water were suspended in a Coastal Fjord.  CO2 was bubbled through three of these bags to simulate ocean acidification conditions in the year 2100.\nThe other three bags were bubbled with air. A phytoplankton bloom was induced in all six bags and phytoplankton, bacterioplankton and physiochemical characteristics were measured and analyzed over a 18 day period. Water samples from the peak of the phytoplankton bloom were isolated and used to follow the decline of the phytoplankton bloom. Nucleic acid extractions were performed to analyse bacterial diversity and functionality using 454 metagenomics and 454 metatranscriptomics.\n<p>\n\nSequencing the metatranscriptome can provide information about the response of organisms to varying environmental conditions. A methodology for obtaining random whole-community mRNA from a complex microbial assemblage using pyrosequencing was used. The metatranscriptome had, with minimum contamination by ribosomal RNA, significant coverage of abundant transcripts, and included significantly more potentially novel proteins than in the metagenome. \n\n<p>\nFour 454 metatranscriptomic datasets and four 454 metagenomic datasets have been produced. These were derived from 4 samples: Day 1, High CO2 Bag and Day 1, Present Day Bag, refer to the metatranscriptomes from the peak of the bloom; Day 2, High CO2 Bag and Day 2, Present Day Bag, refer to the metatranscriptomes following the decline of the bloom. High CO2 refers to the ocean acidification mesocosm and Present Day refers to the control mesocosm.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=EU012135:EU012221[accn]\">EU012135-EU012221</a> , <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=EU421954:EU421957[accn]\">EU421954-EU421957</a> , <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=EU410956[accn]\">EU410956</a> , <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=EU476008[accn]\">EU476008</a> \n, and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=EU819141:EU819142[accn]\">EU819141-EU819142</a> \nare genomic sequences derived from this study.\n\n<p>\n454 sequence data is available from the Short Read Archive (SRA): <a href=\"ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/TraceDB/ShortRead/SRA000266 \n\">SRA000266</a>.\n\n<p>\n454-metatranscriptomic data is available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO): <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE10119 \n\">GSE10119</a>.","data type":"Metagenome","organization":"Plymouth Marine Laboratory","publication":[{"id":"18725995","Title":"Detection of large numbers of novel sequences in the metatranscriptomes of complex marine microbial communities."},{"id":"18783384","Title":"Potential for phosphonoacetate utilization by marine bacteria in temperate coastal waters."}],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":[null],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2008-03-13","_annotation":{"sample_count":8,"sample_organism":["marine metagenome"],"sample_taxid":["408172"],"sample_host_organism":[],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":[],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"sample_temperature_range":{"min":8.975,"max":9.7},"genome_count":0},"has_analysis":false}

{"type":"bioproject","identifier":"PRJNA30125","organism":"human skin metagenome","title":"Human skin microbiota pilot 2","description":"Skin is the largest organ of the human body.  It serves as a critical barrier to invasion by microbes, while at the same time providing a major home to them.  Skin is a convenient and informative system for microbiome studies.  First, samples can be readily obtained by non-invasive swabs and scrapes.  Second, skin cells undergo a linear program of terminal differentiation resulting in enucleated, cornified cells enabling isolation of microbial nucleic acids with minimal human DNA contamination.  Third, both common and rare dermatologic disorders typically manifest at specific skin sub-sites.  For example, atopic dermatitis (commonly known as eczema) and psoriasis affect the inner and outer elbow, respectively.  Further, skin disorders are frequently associated with multi-faceted microbial infections that are often hard to diagnose and treat.\n<p>\nThis study aims to characterize the microbial community resident on the skin and in the nares in healthy individuals.  Initial characterization will focus on sequencing 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences for community structure determination and analysis of intra- and inter-personal variation.  Twenty distinct sub-sites will be sampled across 10 healthy volunteers by swabbing and scraping.  Sequences from each site will be analyzed for microbial diversity, initially using a 16S rRNA survey and later broadening to include fungi, viruses, archaea and mites.  In addition, bacteria will be cultured on a wide variety of media and isolates representing both abundant and novel species will be selected for whole genome sequencing.\n\n\t<p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=GQ000001:GQ116391 [accn]\">GQ000001-GQ116391 </a> are ribosomal RNA sequences associated with this project.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n","data type":"Metagenome","organization":"National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)","publication":[{"id":"19478181","Title":"Topographical and temporal diversity of the human skin microbiome."},{"id":"23050952","Title":"Shifts in human skin and nares microbiota of healthy children and adults."}],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":[null],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2008-06-10","_annotation":{"sample_count":0,"sample_organism":[],"sample_taxid":[],"sample_host_organism":[],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":[],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"sample_temperature_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"genome_count":0},"has_analysis":false}

Pyrosequencing produced 75,558 putative mRNA reads from a day transcriptome and 75,946 from a night transcriptome. Taxonomic binning of annotated mRNAs indicated that Cyanobacteria contributed a greater percentage of the transcripts (54% of annotated sequences) than expected based on abundance (35% of cell counts and 21% 16S rRNA of libraries), and may represent the most actively transcribing cells in this surface ocean community in both the day and night. Major heterotrophic taxa contributing to the community transcriptome included a-proteobacteria (19% of annotated sequences, most of which were SAR11-related) and g-proteobacteria (4%). The composition of transcript pools was consistent with models of prokaryotic gene expression, including operon-based transcription patterns and an abundance of genes predicted to be highly expressed. Metabolic activities that are shared by many microbial taxa (e.g., glycolysis, citric acid cycle, amino acid biosynthesis, and transcription and translation machinery) were well represented among the community transcripts. There was an overabundance of transcripts for photosynthesis, C1 metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation in the day compared to night, and evidence that energy acquisition is coordinated with solar radiation levels for both autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes. In contrast, housekeeping activities such as amino acid biosynthesis, membrane synthesis and repair, and vitamin biosynthesis were overrepresented in the night transcriptome. Direct sequencing of these environmental transcripts has provided detailed information on metabolic and biogeochemical responses of a microbial community to solar forcing.\n\n<p>\n<p>\n454 transcriptome data is available from the Short Read Archive (SRA): <a href=\"ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/TraceDB/ShortRead/SRA003648\n\">SRA003648</a>.\n","data type":"Transcriptome or Gene expression","organization":"University of Georgia","publication":[],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":["SAMN00001340"],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2008-12-30","_annotation":{"sample_count":2,"sample_organism":["marine metagenome"],"sample_taxid":["408172"],"sample_host_organism":[],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":["Pacific Ocean: North Pacific Subtropical Gyre"],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"sample_temperature_range":{"min":25.26,"max":26.16},"genome_count":0},"has_analysis":false}

The ability of antibiotic\nresistance to quickly spread among bacteria coupled with the decrease in the rate of\ndiscovery of novel antibiotics could have catastrophic effects on our ability to treat\ndisease caused by bacteria. By understanding more about the types of antibiotic\nresistance genes in natural environments and the bacteria that harbor those genes, we\nhope to be better equipped to manage antibiotic resistance.\n<p>\nOur study focuses on soil bacterial communities found in a southern Wisconsin apple\norchard. Apple orchards worldwide are plagued by fire blight, a disease caused by the\nbacterium, Erwinia amylovora. In an effort to control this disease, farmers have resorted\nto spraying antibiotics on susceptible varieties of apple trees.

This study characterized the viral community found in reclaimed water and compared it to viruses in potable water.  Reclaimed water contained 1000-fold more virus-like particles (VLPs) than potable water, having approximately 108 VLPs per milliliter. Metagenomic analyses revealed that most of the viruses in both reclaimed and potable water were novel. Bacteriophages dominated the DNA viral community in both reclaimed and potable water, but reclaimed water had a distinct phage community based on phage family distributions and host representation within each family. Eukaryotic viruses similar to plant pathogens and invertebrate picornaviruses dominated RNA metagenomic libraries. Established human pathogens were not detected in reclaimed water viral metagenomes, which contained a wealth of novel single-stranded DNA and RNA viruses related to plant, animal, and insect viruses. Therefore reclaimed water may play a role in the dissemination of highly stable viruses. Information regarding viruses present in reclaimed water but not in potable water can be used to identify new bioindicators of water quality.  Future studies will need to investigate the infectivity and host range of these viruses to evaluate the impacts of reclaimed water use on human and ecosystem health.\n\n<p>\nThis study aimed to identify dominant viral types in reclaimed water and compare it to viral types in potable water. For this purpose, six metagenomic libraries were constructed from reclaimed water samples (n = 3) and potable water (n = 1).

{"type":"bioproject","identifier":"PRJNA38721","organism":"phyllosphere metagenome","title":"Metagenome isolated from the soybean phyllosphere","description":"For terrestrial plants, the phyllosphere represents the interface between the above-ground parts of plants and the air. Conservative estimates indicate that the roughly one billion square kilometers of world-wide leaf surfaces host more than 10e26 bacteria, which are the most abundant colonizers of this habitat. The overall microbiota in this ecosystem is thus sufficiently large to have an impact on the global carbon and nitrogen cycles. Additionally, the phyllosphere inhabitants influence their hosts at the level of the individual plants. To a large extent, interest in phyllosphere microbiology has been driven by investigations on plant pathogens. Their spread, colonization, survival, and pathogenicity mechanisms have been subject of numerous studies. \n\n<p>\nMuch less understood are non-pathogenic microorganisms that inhabit the phyllosphere. The composition of the phyllosphere microbiota has been analyzed in only a few studies by cultivation-independent methods. However, such methods are essential in light of the yet uncultivated majority of bacteria existing in nature.\nNot only their identity, but in particular the physiological properties of phyllosphere bacteria, their adaptations to the habitat, and their potential role, e.g. with respect to modulating population sizes of pathogens, remain largely unknown. \n\n<p>\nCurrent knowledge on the traits important in the phyllosphere is derived from relatively few studies on gene expression, and stems mostly from model bacteria cultivated on host plants under controlled conditions. However, under natural conditions, plants and their residing microorganisms are exposed to a host of diverse, highly variable environmental factors including UV light, temperature, and water availability; moreover, individual microbes are subjected to competition with other microorganisms over resources such as nutrients and space. Towards a deeper understanding of phyllosphere microbiology, and in particular to learn more about the commensal majority of plant leaf colonizing bacteria, which may be of relevance for plant health and development, integrated approaches are needed. \n\n<p>\nMetagenomic and metaproteomic approaches (community\nproteogenomics) were combined in our study to analyze bacterial phyllosphere communities in situ (the phyllosphere is defined here as the environment comprising both the surface and the apoplast of leaves).\nThis strategy provided insight into the physiology of bacteria and revealed common adaptation mechanisms among the phyllosphere populations. \n\n<p>\nIn this study, genomic DNA was isolated from the microbial phyllosphere community of leaves from agriculturally grown soybean (Glycine max).\n\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?holding=&db=Nucleotide&cmd=search&term=FN421717:FN421842[accn]\">FN421717-FN421842 </a> are ribosomal RNA sequences associated with this project.\n\n\n","data type":"Metagenome","organization":"ETHZ (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich)","publication":[],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":[null],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2009-06-29","_annotation":{"sample_count":1,"sample_organism":["phyllosphere metagenome"],"sample_taxid":["662107"],"sample_host_organism":[],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":[],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"sample_temperature_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"genome_count":0},"has_analysis":false}

Before inoculation, the gut content of RSS affected chicken was centrifuged at 4°C for 30 min at 3000 x g. the obtained supernatant was filtered first through a 0.45 mkm filter followed by filtration through a 0.22 um filter. A second group of broilers was mock-infected with phosphate buffered saline. Five days, 8 d, and 12 d after infection, 10 birds of each group were euthanized and necropsy was performed. The duodenal loop was taken for histological examination. The analysis of the sections showed that cystic lesions were only present in the infected group. The highest number of lesions was observed at 8 d after infection. Based on this result the gut content harvested at 5 d after infection was used for subsequent experiments. \n\n<p>\nThe purification of the gut content was performed following a multi-step centrifugation protocol. In a first step, the samples were centrifuged at 16000 x g to remove cellular organelles and debris. The obtained supernatant was filtered twice as described above. Next the filtrate was centrifuged through a 10% sucrose cushion made in TEN buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) at 174899 x g for 3h. The obtained pellets (RSS+, RSS-) were resuspended in 400 mkl TEN buffer. To purify nucleic acids, the RNA and DNA localized outside of viral particles needed to be degraded. To this end, 40 mkl of 10x DNA I buffer (Roche), 20 units of DNase I (Roche) and 10 ug of RNase I (Roche) was added to 360 mkl of the viral suspension. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37C. Both samples (RSS+, Con) were then split and 200 mkl of each sample was used for purification of either the DNA (QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit, Qiagen) or RNA (High Pure RNA isolation Kit, Roche) following the manufacturers instructions. The resulting samples (RSS+ RNA, RSS- RNA, RSS+ DNA and RSS- DNA) were amplified separately using two different protocols to amplify the metagenome (called respectively ChickenRuntingStuntingPRnaVir2008, ChickenRuntingStuntingMRnaVir2008, ChickenRuntingStuntingPDnaVir2008 and ChickenRuntingStuntingMDnaVir2008). The RNA containing samples were amplified using the Transplex Whole Transcriptome Amplification Kit (Sigma). The amplification of the DNA library for both DNA samples was performed using GenomiPhi V2 DNA Amplification Kit (GE Healthcare). Both protocols were applied as recommended by the manufacturer. The resulting cDNA library was submitted to 454 Life Science for sequencing using the GS-FLX platform.

The crater thereby formed is the only hypervelocity meteoritic impact crater on basalt rock. Initial appreciation of the lake was, as of volcanic origin, but now it is recognized as an impact crater created by the hypervelocity impact of either a comet or a meteorite. The presence of plagioclase that has been either converted into maskelynite or contains planar deformation features (PDFs) has confirmed the impact origin of this crater.\n\n<p>\nA lake that evolved in the resulting basaltic rock formation, is both saline and alkaline in nature.

Lonar Lake has a mean diameter of 1.2 kilometres (3,900 ft) and is about 137 metres (450 ft) below the crater rim. The meteor crater rim is about 1.8 kilometres (5,900 ft) in diameter. The circular depression bears a saline water lake in its central portion. The crater's age is estimated to be 52,000 ± 6,000 years (Pleistocene). It is the second largest impact crater in basaltic rock and is partially filled by a salt water lake.

Here we explore the effect of salinity on amino acid preference on an environmental scale. Via pyrosequencing, we have obtained two distinct metagenomic data sets from the Dead Sea, one from a 1992 archaeal bloom and one from the modern Dead Sea. Our data, along with metagenomes from environments representing a range of salinities, show a strong linear correlation (R2=0.97) between the salinity of an environment and the ratio of acidic to basic amino acids encoded by its inhabitants. Using the amino acid composition of putative protein-encoding reads and the results of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we differentiate recovered sequences representing microorganisms indigenous to the Dead Sea from lateral gene transfer events and foreign DNA. Our methods demonstrate lateral gene transfer events between a halophilic archaeon and relatives of the thermophilic bacterial genus Thermotoga and suggest the presence of indigenous Dead Sea representatives from 10 traditionally non-hyperhalophilic bacterial lineages. The work suggests the possibility that amino acid bias of hypersaline environments might be preservable in fossil DNA or fossil amino acids, serving as a proxy for the salinity of an ancient environment. Finally, both the amino acid profile of the 2007 Dead Sea metagenome and the V9 amplicon library support the conclusion that the dominant microorganism inhabiting the Dead Sea is most closely related to a thus far uncultured relative of an alkaliphilic haloarchaeon.\n<p>\nSequences deposited into the Sequence Read Archive can be found using the Project data link.","data type":"Metagenome","organization":"Penn State","publication":[],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":[null],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2010-01-19","_annotation":{"sample_count":2,"sample_organism":["marine metagenome"],"sample_taxid":["408172"],"sample_host_organism":[],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":[],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"sample_temperature_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"genome_count":0},"has_analysis":false}

Culture-based methods have been the primary techniques used to study microbes inhabiting humans; however, many species are not successfully grown in culture. The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research Human Microbiome Project (HMP) aims to investigate the microbes in the gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, skin, vagina, and nares. The goal of the HMP is to comprehensively characterize the human microbiota and analyze its role in human health and disease.\n<p>\n\nThe skin serves not only as a barrier against invading pathogens and moisture loss, but also as a host to microbial communities. The skin of an adult is an approximately 2 square meter surface with a myriad of microenvironments.  Atopic dermatitis (AD), more commonly known as eczema, is a common skin disorder that is exacerbated by Staphylococcus aureus colonization.  This study aims to investigate the skin microbiota of AD patients at specific timepoints (quiescence, disease flares, and post-treatment) to examine how disease state correlates with changes in the skin microflora.   \n<p>\nThe 16S small subunit ribosomal (rRNA) gene is present in every bacterial cell, serving as a universal marker. The gene is sufficiently conserved to allow accurate alignment but adequately varied to enable phylogenetic analyses. Sequencing via 16S rRNA-based phylotyping has been used to survey the bacterial microbes on the skin.  Initially, we will examine the bacterial diversity associated with AD using a 16S rRNA survey and later broadening to include fungi, viruses, archaea and mites. In addition, bacteria will be cultured on a wide variety of media and isolates representing both abundant and novel species will be selected for whole genome sequencing.\n<p>\nTo characterize fungal diversity, we utilize two phylogenetic markers within the rDNA region: 18S rRNA and the Intervening Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region.  Full microbial diversity will be explored with shotgun metagenomic sequencing.","data type":"Genome sequencing and assembly","organization":"NISC - NIH Intramural Sequencing

It occurs suddenly, usually during the first month of life, and we don't know how to prevent it. It is probably more dangerous to premature infants than lung disease today. About one-third of children die and many of the survivors are left with very little intestines. NEC is a disorder that we think might relate to the microbes in the gut. We propose to study this disease intensively, compare cases to controls especially in the days leading up to NEC, and try to determine what differentiates the patients who get this disorder from those who don't. We might then be able to alter these factors, and prevent this abdominal catastrophe from occurring.

The seasonal structure of microbial communities in the Western English Channel - 2007 \n<p>\nHere we present a multi-omic study of the Bacterial and Archaeal diversity found at the L4 long-term marine observatory.  We have previously generated a six year time series from L4 that showed that the bacterial community shows strong seasonal structuring and diversity peaks every year on the winter solstice.  Here we further confirm this pattern by extending this study to include genes and transcripts generated for eight additional time points in 2008.  This data includes further 16S datasets as well as eight metagenomes (1.2GB) and eight metatranscriptomes (157MB).  These time points cover three seasons (Jan, April and August) and include day and night (diel) samples.  In addition, the August samples (4) include 4 consecutive samplings within 24 hours at six hour intervals.  Using these data we test whether Archaea also show the same observed seasonal patterns and whether these patterns hold true at the gene (functional) level. \n<p>\nAnalysis of this combined data set allows five main conclusions to be drawn.  First, Archaea show evidence of following the same seasonal patterns as Bacteria, but have ~6% the richness.  Second, for both Bacteria and Archaea, we confirm that higher 16S diversity reflects higher diversity at the gene-level (including expressed genes) and this diversity also peaks at the winter solstice. Third, interestingly, detectable diversity appears to be higher at night, and this is of special potential relevance as there is more diversity in winter when nights are longer.  Fourth, despite the diversity of these communities, night and day samples taken using Lagrangian (drift) sampling were successful in isolating the same community suggesting communities are more structured than is commonly believed. Finally, this data, as expected, contains a large proportion of orphan genes without known homologues.  When compared to the housekeeping genes identified through SEED subsystem classification, these unknown genes appear to be driving the differences between samples across seasons.  This underscores the importance of determining the functions of more of these sequences in the future. \n<p>\nIn summary, this study further confirms the strong seasonal patterns characterizing both the bacterial and archaeal communities at this important marine site.  The finding that, despite the huge diversity of these communities, there are evident signs of predictable patterns and detectable stability over time provides compelling evidence that renewed efforts should","data type":"Metagenome","organization":"Plymouth Marine Laboratory","publication":[{"id":"19659500","Title":"The seasonal structure of microbial communities in the Western English Channel."},{"id":"21304748","Title":"Metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from the L4 long-term coastal monitoring station in the Western English Channel."}],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":[null],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2010-03-15","_annotation":{"sample_count":12,"sample_organism":["marine metagenome"],"sample_taxid":["408172"],"sample_host_organism":[],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":["United Kingdom"],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"sample_temperature_range":{"min":10.0,"max":15.9623},"genome_count":0},"has_analysis":false}

Using default protocol v4.2., data for the 16S window spanning V3-V5 was generated for all samples, with a second 16S window spanning V1-V3 generated for a majority of the samples. 16S rRNA sequencing is being used to characterize the complexity of microbial communities at individual body sites, and to determine whether there is a core microbiome at each site.

The spectrum of diseases that will be studied includes but is not limited to respiratory illness, gastroenteritis, encephalitis, fever of unknown etiology, hepatitis, influenza-like illness, cancer, and autoimmune disease.  \n<p>\nBriefly, we are using high throughput sequencing technology to identify novel viruses that may be causing different types of illness in patients who have undergone thorough medical evaluation, are suspected of infectious disease by their physicians, but whose tests have not yielded a source of infection.  These samples have been screened with our Virochip which may or may not have identified a possible source.  These samples were obtained through UCSF and/or as referrals from other institutions across the globe.\n<p>\nThis project includes short Illumina reads of various depths sequenced from metagenomic RNA of sputum, blood, CSF, and diarrheal samples of patients with suspected infectious diseases unable to be confirmed by standard clinical tests.","data type":"Metagenome","organization":"UCSF-Abbott Viral Diagnostics Center","publication":[],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":["SAMN03652775"],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2010-09-03","_annotation":{"sample_count":144,"sample_organism":["Zaire ebolavirus","human metagenome"],"sample_taxid":["186538","646099"],"sample_host_organism":["Homo sapiens"],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":["Zaire:Lomela-Lokolia","not applicable"],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"sample_temperature_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"genome_count":0},"has_analysis":false}

{"type":"bioproject","identifier":"PRJNA60545","organism":"soil metagenome","title":"Metagenomes isolated from NE Brazil","description":"Mangroves are important and productive ecosystems found in tropical and subtropical environments, providing habitats for a variety of species. These ecosystems have been suffering from impacts through the years and consequently the activity of soil microorganisms, which are directly related to valuable processes in these environments, is affected. Understanding the diversity and function of microbial communities and their response to environmental changes is essential for the maintenance of significant functions in these ecosystems. Currently few studies in Brazil are devoted to the understanding of microbial diversity in mangrove soils. Thus it becomes essential to study the microbial diversity in these environments and to search for genes encoding for enzymes of biotechnological interest. For this reason, the aim of this study was to assess the soil microbial diversity from four mangroves in Ceara state, northeast Brazil, and its response to possible impacts, and search genes of biotechnological interest using metagenomics strategies.\n\nThe four studied mangroves are located in the state of Ceara, northeastern Brazil. Two of them are located in the extreme east (Jaguaribe Mangrove) and west (the Mangrove Timonha) coast of the state separated by 530 km and the other two are located in a central region, near the city of Fortaleza, state capital (Coco and Pacoti mangroves). Jaguaribe (JAG) mangrove is located at the largest river of the state, in a sub-urbanized region, and impacted by agriculture run-off and extensive shrimp farming. In contrast, Timonha (TIM) is an undisturbed mangrove, located in an island inside the estuary, with limited access to humans. The Cocó (COC) and Pacoti (PAC) mangroves, located in the metropolitan region of Fortaleza, suffer impacts due to water pollution, deforestation of native vegetation, especially vegetation of dunes and mangroves, extraction of sand, clay, stone and release of industrial effluents. The sampling locations TIM - S 02º56.587’ W 041º19.064’; JAG - S 04°26.749’ W 37°46.989’; PAC - S 03º49.226’ W 038º24.286’; COC - S 03°46.482’ W 38°26.552’. Sediment samples were collected in three sites inside the mangroves aiming to cover typical habitats in this ecosystems: near the river, Rhizophora mangle forest and the last one in an area covered by Avicennia schaueriana. In each habitat five sediment cores from 0-10 cm layer in an area of 10 m2, in the low tide of 0.0, were collected. The fifteen samples from each mangrove were pooled to form a single composite sample and DNA metagenomic extraction was carried out using the PowerMaxSoil DNA Extraction kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol.

Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences collected approximately daily revealed three compositional phases during colonization. We reconstructed genomes of the dominant organisms and intensively curated population genomic datasets from the third phase. In the third phase, the communities were dominated by a nearly clonal Serratia population, two Citrobacter strains sharing >99% nucleotide identity, and contained a lower abundance Enterococcus population, multiple plasmids and bacteriophage. The relative abundance of the Citrobacter strains changed significantly over time. Modeling of Citrobacter strain abundances suggests differences in growth rates and/or host colonization patterns. We identified genotypic variation potentially responsible for divergent strain ecologies, including hotspots of sequence variation in regulatory genes and intergenic regions, and in genes involved in transport, flagellar biosynthesis, substrate metabolism, and host colonization, as well as differences in the complements of these genes. Our results demonstrate that a community genomic approach can elucidate gut microbial colonization at the resolution required to discern medically relevant strain and species population dynamics, and hence improve our ability to diagnose and treat microbial community-mediated disorders.","data type":"Genome sequencing and assembly","organization":"Univ. of Calif.

{"type":"bioproject","identifier":"PRJNA63661","organism":"human gut metagenome strain:n/a","title":"Microbial composition of samples from infant gut","description":"The microbial composition of the gut likely contributes to a wide-range of health and disease states including intestinal inflammation, atopic disease, and possibly diseases of adulthood, such as heart disease and obesity. The early establishment of the gut microflora is suspected to have a particularly profound impact protecting the gut from infectious disease and on long-term subsequent health by predisposing individuals to atopic or autoimmune disease later in life. In contrast to the large-scale efforts of the Human Microbiome Project to characterize the microbial flora of healthy adults, relatively little has been accomplished to characterize the early establishment of the microbiota in infants. <p>\nThe administration of antibiotics to infants has the capacity to profoundly affect the early acquisition, establishment, and natural maturation of commensal microflora. Prematurity is another major factor that is thought to influence 'normal' gut microbial composition in early life. A high number of pre-term infants receive antibiotic therapy prophylactically; the immediate and long-term effects of antibiotic treatment on infant and later health outcomes are unknown. We hypothesize that gestational age influences the ability to support 'normal' gut microbiota, and that antibiotic administration in the first few weeks of life can alter or delay the development of a 'normal' microbiota and may lead to adverse health outcomes. If we hope to promote the healthy establishment of early gut colonization and thereby improve health outcomes, we need to establish what 'normal' colonization looks like across gestational ages and apply this knowledge as a benchmark to understand the impact of antibiotic treatment in early postnatal life. <p>\nIn this project, we propose to examine the microbiome in four cohorts ranging from extremely preterm to term, with birth weights appropriate for gestational age: Group 1) 23 to 27 weeks and extremely low birth weight [ELBW, <1000 grams]; Group 2) 28 to 32 weeks and very low birth weight [VLBW, >1000 to <1500 grams]; Group 3) 33 to 36 weeks and low birth weight [LBW, >1500 to <2500 grams]; and Group 4) term (37 to 42 weeks) and normal [>2500 to <4000 gram] birth weight. The infant gut microbiome will be assessed longitudinally in study infants from the first postnatal week to 18 months of age, and will include untreated and antibiotic-treated infants. \n","data type":"Metagenome","organization":"Broad Institute","publication":[{"id":"34083435","Title":"A catalog of tens of thousands of viruses from human metagenomes reveals hidden associations with chronic diseases."}],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":["SAMN01828443"],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2011-03-14","_annotation":{"sample_count":1564,"sample_organism":["unidentified","human gut metagenome"],"sample_taxid":["32644","408170"],"sample_host_organism":["missing","Unknown","Homo sapiens"],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":["missing","USA"],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"sample_temperature_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"genome_count":0},"has_analysis":false}

These samples were treated with flow cytometry to enrich for Synechococcal species (select on the basis of fluorescence of photosynthetic pigments). The metagenomes obtained allow the elucidation of both the composition of each individual metagenome, and seasonal fluctuation in the Synechococcal population. \n<p>\nSynechococcus are oxygenic photoautotrophic cyanobacteria found throughout the world's oceans. Due to their photosynthetic lifestyle and sheer abundance, they are significant participants in oceanic primary production and the global carbon cycle (Johnson and Sieburth, 1979; Waterbury et al., 1979; Glover, 1985; Li, 1994) (Richardson and Jackson, 2007). There is a strong foundation of genetic information describing the diversity of marine Synechococcus. They are a closely related group of microorganisms sharing greater than 95% of their 16S rRNA gene sequences (Urbach et al., 1998; Fuller et al., 2003) and multiple genomes of these organisms are now available, for example (Palenik et al., 2003; Palenik et al., 2006). Within this group, multiple clades have been identified (Ferris and Palenik, 1998; Rocap et al., 2002; Fuller et al., 2003), some with distinct physiological capabilities (Toledo et al., 1999). Surprisingly up to 15% of the genes in some Synechococcus strain genomes carry characteristic signatures of horizontal gene transfer and are reminiscent of pathogenicity islands (Palenik et al., 2003; Palenik et al., 2006). A comprehensive analysis of this has now been done for available Synechococcus genomes ( Dufresne et al., 2008).\n<p>\nUsing high speed flow cytometric sorting based on its phycoerythrin fluorescence to greatly enrich for Synechococcus, we obtained cells and subsequently metagenome data from a natural population.

Samples were enriched with the organic sulfur compound DMSP (25 nM, final concentration) and compared with a no-addition control. An average of 270,675 unique reads were obtained per treatment after using 454 pyrosequencing technology to sequence the extracted and amplified messenger RNA (mRNA). Approximately 41% of the reads were assigned a protein function based on BLAST analysis against the NCBI RefSeq database. Transcripts in the DMSP treatment had more frequent hits to Gammaproteobacteria, suggesting that this group might be the first to react when DMSP becomes available. DMSP enrichment resulted in relatively higher expression of genes required for growth and energy generation. Separate specific enrichments with various products of DMSP degradation were also performed along with biogeochemical rate measurements (DMSP uptake, consumption and assimilation). Using bioinformatic tools to identify transcripts from known DMSP-related genes, we generated ecosystem-specific primers for several DMSP degradation steps. Rate measurements were less sensitive in tracking subtle changes in sulfur cycling than direct tracking of gene expression.","data type":"targeted loci","organization":"Marine Science Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara","publication":[],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":[],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2011-09-28","dateModified":"2011-09-28","_annotation":{"sample_count":1,"sample_organism":["unidentified marine bacterioplankton"],"sample_taxid":["13136"],"sample_host_organism":[],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":[],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"sample_temperature_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"genome_count":0},"has_analysis":false}

To meet this objective, we investigated whether we can predict the activity level of a specific biochemical function based on the abundance of the corresponding gene transcript within measured community metatranscriptomes.  In addition, we investigated the lower limit of a microorganism?s abundance that still allows detection of its transcripts within a metatranscriptome and prediction of the activity levels of the enzyme encoded by the transcript.  To do this, we amended an undefined microbial community that was derived from activated sludge with varying fractions of an E. coli strain that can catalyze a specific transformation reaction for the herbicide atrazine.  This reaction is performed by an enzyme encoded by the AtzA transcript. We observed a linear and proportional relationship between the activity level of the transformation reaction and the abundance of the AtzA transcript down to an E. coli cell density of 0.05% of the population.","data type":"transcriptome","organization":"Eawag","publication":[],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":[],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2011-10-03","dateModified":"2011-10-03","_annotation":{"sample_count":6,"sample_organism":["wastewater metagenome"],"sample_taxid":["527639"],"sample_host_organism":[],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":[],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"sample_temperature_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"genome_count":0},"has_analysis":false}

A combined metagenomic and metaproteomic approach was applied to determine the metabolic pathways expressed in a naturally enriched ANME-1 community in cold-seep sediment at Nyegga. In total, 16.6 Mbp sequence information was assembled into contigs and taxonomic analysis revealed a dominance of Archaeal sequences comprising 74 % of the metagenome where ANME-1 constituted 66 % and ANME-2 0.01 %, respectively. Open reading frame translations were used as database for protein identifications and of the 356 proteins identified in the sediment sample, 245 were associated with ANME-1. All enzymes of the reverse methanogenesis pathway, except N5N10-Methylene-Tetrahydromethanopterin reductase (mer), were expressed in the sediments by ANME-1, hence validating on the protein level, anaerobic methane oxidation via this pathway in cold seep sediments. Any knowledge on bypassing-mechanisms of the mer-catalyzed reaction was neither retrieved from the metagenomic nor the metaproteomic data. However, although constituting, a minor fraction of the microbial community, an ANME-2c affiliated mer was expressed as well as the subunits of the key enzyme methyl-CoM reductase. The key enzymes, APS-reductase and sulfite reductase in the dissimilatory sulfate-reduction pathway were expressed in the sediments by at least two different members of Deltaproteobacteria. The approach is applicable to reveal dominating in situ metabolism on the protein level of ANME-dominated sedimentary ecosystems.","data type":"Genome sequencing and assembly","organization":"Centre for Geobiology, University of Bergen","publication":[{"id":"22404914","Title":"Integrated metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses of an ANME-1-dominated community in marine cold seep sediments."}],"properties":null,"dbXrefs":[],"distribution":null,"Download":null,"status":"public","visibility":null,"dateCreated":"2011-10-07","dateModified":"2011-10-07","datePublished":"2012-08-14T00:00:00Z","_annotation":{"sample_count":1,"sample_organism":["sediment metagenome"],"sample_taxid":["749907"],"sample_host_organism":[],"sample_host_organism_id":[],"sample_host_disease":[],"sample_host_disease_id":[],"sample_host_location":[],"sample_host_location_id":[],"data_size":"0.0 GB","sample_ph_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"sample_temperature_range":{"min":null,"max":null},"genome_count":0},"has_analysis":false}
